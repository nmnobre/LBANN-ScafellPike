# A script to silently install LBANN on Scafell Pike

This repo hosts a script that uses [Spack](https://spack.io) to automate the installation of [LBANN](https://software.llnl.gov/lbann) with CUDA support on Scafell Pike, the Hartree Centre's supercomputer.
Just run `./lbann.sh` and... go grab a coffee, it's going to take a while...
